# SecurBot

## Project description

This project is landing page for local CCTV bussiness "SecurBot" by Siddjarth Enterprises in Navi-Mumbai. I utilized "serverless functions" to provide a psuedo backend support to a static site.

## Live link

[securbot.in](securbot.in)

## Feautures

```
1. Modularized code.
2. Responsive UI accross all screen sizes.
3. Provided an Admin-panel where user can view reviews or feedbacks for approval.
4. Utilized lambda-functions to provide a shareble review link, once user gives a feedback or review using this link it gets sent to admin panel for approval.
5. Utilized react-spring for basic animation and page transition.
6. Contact us form, which when a customer submits, a mail containing customer details is sent to Admin using SENDGRID.
7. Used svgs and sass/scss to style.
